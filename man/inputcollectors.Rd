\title{End-user functions that collect a specific \code{input}}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string. The path to the simulation project folder
that contains the individual folder of each simulated site.}

\item{name_sw2_run}{A character string. The name of the folder
(or zip archive, see \code{zipped_runs}) of the simulated site
for which metrics are to be calculated.
\pkg{rSOILWAT2} input and output is organized following conventions of
\pkg{rSFSW2}, i.e., inputs for each scenario are stored in a list object
named \var{\dQuote{swRunScenariosData}} which is stored
on disk as a file \var{\dQuote{sw_input.RData}};
and output data is stored for each scenario separately in an object
named \var{\dQuote{runDataSC}}
in a file \var{\dQuote{sw_output_scX.RData}} where
\code{X} is the number of the scenario.}

\item{zipped_runs}{A logical value. Describes whether \code{name_sw2_run}
is a zip archive or a regular folder.}

\item{id_scen}{An integer value. The scenario number for which
input values are to be collected.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\description{
These functions have a name that starts with \code{collect_input_}.
They have at least the following arguments:
\code{path}, \code{name_sw2_run}, \code{zipped_runs}, and \code{...}.
