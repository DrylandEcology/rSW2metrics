\title{Annual time series underlying the 19 R&R predictors}
\usage{
metric_RR2022predictors_annual(
  path,
  name_sw2_run,
  id_scen_used,
  list_years_scen_used,
  out = c("ts_years", "raw"),
  zipped_runs = FALSE,
  soils,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string. The path to the simulation project folder
that contains the individual folder of each simulated site.}

\item{name_sw2_run}{A character string. The name of the folder
(or zip archive, see \code{zipped_runs}) of the simulated site
for which metrics are to be calculated.
\pkg{rSOILWAT2} input and output is organized following conventions of
\pkg{rSFSW2}, i.e., inputs for each scenario are stored in a list object
named \var{\dQuote{swRunScenariosData}} which is stored
on disk as a file \var{\dQuote{sw_input.RData}};
and output data is stored for each scenario separately in an object
named \var{\dQuote{runDataSC}}
in a file \var{\dQuote{sw_output_scX.RData}} where
\code{X} is the number of the scenario.}

\item{id_scen_used}{An integer vector. The numbers of scenarios for which
metrics are to be calculated.}

\item{list_years_scen_used}{A list of integer vectors.
Each scenario in \code{id_scen_used} must have a corresponding vector of
calendar years (for which the metrics) will be calculated.}

\item{out}{A character string. Signaling whether the functions returns
a time series of yearly values or an aggregate (e.g., mean) across years.
One of \var{\dQuote{ts_years}} or \var{\dQuote{across_years}}.}

\item{zipped_runs}{A logical value. Describes whether \code{name_sw2_run}
is a zip archive or a regular folder.}

\item{soils}{A named list of numeric vectors. The presence of the
argument \code{soils} indicates that the function in question requires
soil information as inputs.
The named elements include \var{\dQuote{depth_cm}},
\var{\dQuote{sand_frac}}, and \var{\dQuote{clay_frac}} and
contain the respective values for each soil layer at the site.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}

\description{
The 19 predictors of resilience & resistance indicators
(see \code{metric_RR2022predictors_annualClim()}) are long-term
means, standard deviations, or coefficients of variation of
annual values.
